# Hotel Booking
### Description 
HotelBooking is a hotel booking web application built to test my aptitude in writing and integrating PHP and MySQL code. The user creates and account and is allowed to make bookings from a select list of hotels, review their bookings, confirm them and cancel them.
The application checks for errors in the login and register processes and checks for double bookings.

## Prerequisites

- WAMP, XAMPP or alternative _(to run PHP and MySQL in the browser)_.
- Any browser with JavaScript support.
